Assignment 2 - Python Control Structures

This repo has two Python programs:

1. task-1.py  
   → Takes an integer input from the user, checks if it is even or odd using if-else, and shows the result.

2. task-2.py  
   → Uses a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 and prints the total.
